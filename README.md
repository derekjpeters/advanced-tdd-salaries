# Advanced TDD Lesson: Filter Out Low Salaries

Welcome to the Test Driven Development (TDD) activity!

In this exercise, you will learn how to apply the TDD methodology using JavaScript and Jest. Your goal is to write tests and then code to filter out salaries less than $50,000 from an array.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- How to write unit tests with Jest
- How to validate input and handle edge cases
- How to improve code iteratively with confidence

## 📁 Project Structure

```
advanced-tdd-salaries/
├── removeSalaries.js          # Your function implementation
├── removeSalaries.test.js     # Your Jest test file
└── package.json               # Project metadata and dependencies
```

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Unzip the Project**  
   Extract the zip file in your desired folder.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Tests**

   ```
   npm test
   ```

   You’ll see which tests are passing and which are failing.

## ✅ TDD Summary

**Red**: Write a failing test  
**Green**: Write the least amount of code to pass the test  
**Refactor**: Improve the code without changing functionality  

Repeat the cycle for each new requirement.
